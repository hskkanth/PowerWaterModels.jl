# Constraints
We define the following methods to provide a compositional approach toward defining linking constraints used in coupled power-water models.
Such methods should always be defined over `AbstractPowerWaterModel`.

```@autodocs
Modules = [PowerWaterModels]
Pages   = ["core/constraint.jl"]
Order   = [:type, :function]
Private  = true
```
